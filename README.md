# Installation 
### Operating System Support 

The Aparavi software is supported on the following operating systems. 

- Windows OS (x64 only) 
- Windows Server 2019  
- Windows Server 2016  
- Windows Server 2012 R2  
- Windows 10 (Supported for Collector installation. Not as an Aggregator)
- Linux OS (x64 only)2
- Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 
- Debian 9.x and 10 
- Red Hat (RHEL) 8.x 
- CentOS 8.x 
- Suse Enterprise 15 
- Linux distributions must have libc 2.23 or greater installed 

### Database Support 
The Aggregator and Aggregator-Collector require a database to store file metadata. The database may be installed on the same server as an Aggregator or on a separate server accessible by the Aggregator. Multiple Aggregators may access the same database. Supported database types include: 

- MySQL 8.0.x

### Data Sources 
Aparavi software can access files systems on which the Aggregator-Collector or Collector is installed. In addition, Aparavi can access files using the SMB file share protocol. Over time the supported source types will grow to include other options.  

### Supported data sources include the following. 

### File Systems
- Windows file systems 
- Linux file systems 
- SMB file share protocols â€“ 2.x and 3.x 

To access Windows file shares from Linux servers, Samba client libraries (libsmbclient) will be automatically installed by Aparavi on the Linux server. To access Linux files shares from Windows servers, Samba server libraries must be installed and configured on the linux server. 

### Documentation

The documentation files are in the section `Documentation`.
